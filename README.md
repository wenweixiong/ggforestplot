# ggforestplot (modified)
The package is for plotting forest plots typically used to represent summary statistics from statistical models consisting of a point estimate (e.g., odds ratio or beta coefficient), lower and upper bound of the point estimate (e.g. 95% confidence interval), and statistical significant (i.e., p-value).

This package has been modified from the original package by Nightingale (https://github.com/NightingaleHealth/ggforestplot).
